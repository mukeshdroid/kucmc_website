        <p>
          Established in 2018,
         </p>


        <p>Recognizing the need for a dedicated space within our department, a group of enthusiastic and visionary students came together to form KUCMC, in 2018. Through their collective efforts, they worked diligently to gain recognition from the university administration and garner support from faculty members. With their determination and perseverance, KUCMC officially became a recognized club, opening doors for students to engage in various academic and extracurricular activities. Since its inception, KUCMC has grown exponentially, attracting students from diverse backgrounds who share a common passion for their respective disciplines. </p>


        <p>Every year, KUCMC holds elections to select a new board that will lead and guide the club forward.Leading up to the elections, interested individuals are given the opportunity to nominate themselves for various positions on the board. These positions typically include President, Vice President,General Secretary,club secretary Treasurer, and other executive members as determined by the club's constitution. Once nominations are received, candidates have the opportunity to present their visions, plans, and qualifications to the members.  This democratic process allows students to actively participate in shaping the future of the club and ensures a smooth transition of leadership.</p>
        <p>In addition to holding annual elections for the new board, KUCMC also conducts interviews as part of its selection process for certain positions within the club. </p>
