How errors well handled!!

1. Bundler Version error
via- https://stackoverflow.com/a/67287741
"""
You need to do the following to ensure the correct default version of Bundler is used for the repo you are working with.

You can run the following but this can present issues as it can break your local gems on your system as ALL of them are updated.

gem update --system
The following method is a much safer way of ensuring Bundler is updated

Get your gem environment and take note of INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY
gem environment
Then run the following
cd <INSTALLATION DIRECTORY>/specifications/default
rm bundler-<old_default_version>.gemspec
gem install --default bundler -v <new_default_version>
If you have followed 2 and that still does not work, then run
gem install bundler:<new_default_version>
to ensure you your local repo is using the correct version

2. Parser error
// internet says to add webrick but it doesn't work
It's because lol ruby 3.x doesn't have webrick (https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/752#issuecomment-877780567)
hence. install ruby 2.7.x

//checking if sabal error removed
