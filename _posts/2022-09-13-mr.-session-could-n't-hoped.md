title: We couldn't have hoped for more enthusiastic crowd and talented trainers.
description:   We couldn't have hoped for more enthusiastic crowd and talented trainers. The workshop on 'Version Control using Git and GitHub' conducted on September 8 was a huge success. The computational mathematics club would like to thank Mr. Ayush Aryal and Mr. Shubhechchhak Pokhrel from Computer Engineering of Kathmandu University for hosting an interactive session on project management and contributing to open source projects. We are grateful to all who attended the session.
